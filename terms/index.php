                    When you order the book, you order through me direct. There is no middle man, as I want to make the whole 
                    process as personal as possible. Each book will be signed, and I aim to get this done as quickly as I can, 
                    so you should hopefully get your book within 3-5 days. In processing it this way, I hope to keep all the 
                    work and services as local as possible. So in buying direct from me, you know youâ€™re supporting the local 
                    people and smaller businesses, not the giant corporations. Thank you.
